      <h1>Year of Exploration &ndash; Aug 2024</h1>
      <span class="subheading">Sep 3, 2024</span>

      <p>This year, I set out on a <a href="https://melodykuo.com/blog/a-year-of-exploration.html">Year of Exploration</a>, a sabbatical where I could explore my every curiosity. I wrote an <a href="https://melodykuo.com/blog/a-year-of-exploration-july-2024.html">update in July</a> about my year so far and committed to writing these updates more frequently. This one covers July and August.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In July, I felt a bit lost on what to do. I was no longer pursuing previous ideas I was working on. I spent my time researching new ideas to work on, but after a few weeks of nothing to work towards, I felt antsy and restless.</p>

      <p>I decided to just pick an idea in real estate tech to build a prototype for. I showed it to people in the industry. Feedback was generally positive, and I felt momentum picking up. Then, as life does, I suddenly found myself working on two additional projects.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Condo Genius</h2>
      <h3>What it is</h3>
      <p>My partner and I have been considering buying a place for a while. If you get far along the process of buying a condo, you discover status certificates. Status certificates are a collection of documents that help you understand the financial health of the condo building, through reserve funds, operating budgets, etc.</p>

      <p>These are long, dense financial documents. Condo Genius extracts, summarizes, and analyzes them. This gives prospective buyers more confidence in their purchase, and real estate lawyers better tools to work more effectively. Here&rsquo;s an early <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/04bd92bc969d4ce6a5b18418aade690b?sid=b47179b4-3891-4e03-b306-d958b174fc18">demo</a>.</p>

      <h3>What&rsquo;s next</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Talk to more people in the industry for feedback</li>
          <li>Analyze additional pieces of the document</li>
          <li>Provide more meaningful insights</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How you can help</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>If you know any real estate lawyers who would be interested in using this tool, I&rsquo;d love an introduction</li>
          <li>If you have any status certificates you&apos;d like to analyze, I&rsquo;d appreciate if you can send them to me</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>535 Community Fund</h2>
      <h3>What it is</h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;m a member of <a href="https://twitter.com/535toronto">Studio 535</a>, a co-working space for builders in Toronto. We started the <a href="https://535.fund">535 Community Fund</a> to give small grants to interesting people with passionate projects. The thesis is that even small amounts of money can be catalysts for inspiring change.</p>

      <p>In the first few weeks of the fund, we&rsquo;ve given grants to a UWaterloo student building a nuclear fusor at home, a high-school student building a robot inspired by Interstellar&rsquo;s TARS robot, and a high-school grad building a tool to help pharmacists make drug substitutions.</p>

      <h3>What&rsquo;s next</h3>
      <p>We give out grants on a rolling basis, so we&rsquo;re always looking for more grantees and sponsors</p>

      <h3>How you can help</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Help us spread the word to more people. We&rsquo;re particularly interested in reaching more student and creative communities. Feel free to share or point me towards these communities.</li>
          <li>If you resonate with our mission, we&rsquo;re always looking for more sponsors.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>All details can be found at <a href="https://535.fund">535.fund</a>.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Figgy</h2>
      <h3>What it is</h3>
      <p>When we launched the Community Fund, we needed a website for it &ndash; something easy to set-up and hassle-free to maintain. We created the website using Figjam, and it turned out better than either of us expected.</p>

      <p>I created Figgy so that anyone can do the same, with no coding or technical experience. You can learn more about it <a href="https://x.com/melkuo/status/1828787756010750057">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>What&rsquo;s next</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Sharing with more people for feedback</li>
          <li>Experimenting with different ways to grow</li>
          <li>Additional features like custom domains and analytics</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How you can help</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Check it out at <a href="http://figgy.site">figgy.site</a></li>
          <li>Share any Figgies you create with me :)&nbsp;</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Other Projects</h2>
      <p>A grab bag of other things I&rsquo;ve worked on:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>I made <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lomelo">soundscapes</a> with AI to help guide people in deep breathing exercises. The crescendos and decrescendos of the music guide people through the ins and outs of breathing. I used AI to generate sounds, then edited them in GarageBand.</li>
          <li>I think a lot of people in Toronto, especially those in tech, feel a frustration towards the city and its lack of meaningful outcomes. It&rsquo;s hard to escape discussions about &ldquo;brain drain&rdquo;, or &ldquo;how can we make more Shopifies&rdquo;. I wrote an <a href="https://melodykuo.com/blog/a-formula.html">article</a> to provide a framework for how I think about it all.</li>
          <li>My friend Vin can be so annoying on Twitter. In an effort to dunk on him, I created a <a href="https://x.com/melkuo/status/1811422836092727734">GPT</a> that mimics him and his tweets.</li>
      </ul>
