      <h1>A Year of Exploration</h1>
      <span class="subheading">July 4, 2024</span>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>There are two things I’ve come to learn about myself: (1) I have to love what I do in order to excel at it, and (2) I don’t really know what I love to do.</p>
      <p>There are lots of things I <i>think</i> I’d love to do – countless ideas of things to work on, endless fantasies of the type of person I could be. But often, after deciding to try something, I’ll realize that maybe it’s not for me.</p>
      <p>For example, I’ll think, “I love being creative, I should take up watercolour painting.” So I’ll sign up for a course, enjoy it enough while doing it, but never touch my brushes again after the course ends.</p>
      <p>With hobbies, the consequence was just the accumulation of clutter, but it became more problematic with work. I had this pattern of starting jobs with some presumption of why I would love it (“I loved the operational nature of my last company, I think I’d love this ops-heavy company”, or, “I want to make a positive impact on people, I think I’ll love this healthcare company.”), then be maddeningly frustrated at myself for my lack of motivation and mediocre output. I would bang my head asking myself why I couldn’t try harder or anxiously wonder if my best years were behind me.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>I left my job at the end of last year and I decided I was tired of feeling this way. I wanted to take some time to reset. If my intuition was so wrong about what I like, then I wanted to take the time to correct it. If I had all these ideas of what I liked, then I wanted to take the time to explore it. </p>
      <p>I’m going to use the year to explore. A sabbatical where I explore my every curiosity. An opportunity to take a step down all the paths I could take. A year to fuck around and find out.</p>
