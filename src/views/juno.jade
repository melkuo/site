    p Research shows that sexual health education reduces the risk of infection and improves overall well-being. But current methods of seeking health information lack credibility, availability, or contains complex medical jargons. That's why my team is building Juno â€“ an interactive, autonomous Facebook Messenger chatbot that engages in real-time conversations about sexual health to educate young adults.
    p To build Juno, we need to collect a lot of questions and answers. These answers need to be verified by external medical professionals.
    p.problem The dev team need a way to answer and manage questions. Medical professionals need a simple way to verify answers.

  #requirements
    h2 User requirements
    p Use cases for the two user types were developed using a task analysis. The functionality of the system emerges in the bottom row.

  #nav
    h2 Navigation
    p First, the navigation structure was developed. Originally, I thought to organize it like:
    ul
      li All questions
      li Add question
      li All answers
      li Add answer
      li Verify answer
    p Using a card sorting exercise with a classmate, I realized that answers are always linked to questions.

    p For example, "answer question" will always be linked with "all questions". The nav structure will actually be much simpler.
    ul
      li All questions (answer, edit, delete)
      li Add question
      li All answers (edit, delete)

  #wireframing
    h2 Wireframing
    p I did some sketches with pen and paper to get a sense of the layout.

    p As I began to visualize the questions themselves, I wanted them to have a max width, so that there aren't too many words per line, to make it easier to read.

    p The overall structure of the page had to change accordingly to stay balanced.

    p I was happy enough with this direction and implemented it to see how it would actually look.

  #styleguide
    h2 Styleguide
    p For colours, I was inspired by another designer's 
      a(href="http://www.vanschneider.com/colors/" target="_blank") collection of colour combinations
      | . For icons, I used a popular 
      a(href="fontawesome.io/icons") font icon library
      |  for its simplicity and robustness. For fonts, I drew inspiration from 
      a(href="typ.io/libraries/google") font pairing sites
      | .

  #user-feedback
    h2 User feedback
    p We had our friends help us answer questions. We received feedback on what:
    ul
      li Need a way to filter unanswered questions
      li Should return to same page after answering a question
    p The tool was also launched to medical professionals. Their feedback after using it was:
    ul
      li Need a way to filter unverified answers
      li Answer box could be larger
    p I incorporated the feedback.
