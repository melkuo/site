  p Sexual health education is proven to contribute to disease prevention and overall well-being. Current solutions of seeking health information lack credibility, availability or are subject to technical medical jargon. The goal is to design Juno â€“ an interactive, autonomous chatbot that provides understandable and credible information about sexual health to young adults seeking answers.
  p Juno will learn to answer users' using machine learning algorithms. To do this, it needs to be trained with questions and answers. These answers need to be verified by medical professionals.
  p.problem The developing team needs an internal tool to view and manage questions and answers. Medical professionals need a simple way to verify these answers.

  h2#requirements User requirements
  p Use cases for the two user types were developed using a task analysis.

  p From this, the functionality of the system emerges:
  p Questions
  ul
    li Add question
    li Edit question
    li Delete question
    li Answer question
  p Answers
  ul
    li Edit answer
    li Verify answer

  h2#nav Navigation
  p First, the navigation structure was developed. Originally, I thought to organize it like:

  p However, after a card sorting exercise with a classmate, I realized that answers are always linked to questions.
