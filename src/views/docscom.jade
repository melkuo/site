      a(href="http://docs.com" target="_blank") Docs.com 
      | is a site to publish Office documents without losing animations or formatting. As a Program Manager, I redesigned the user flow for publishing a document onto the site.

  #current
    h2 Current upload process

    p.caption The existing upload process.
    p When a user presses "Publish", they're taken through four steps:
    ol
      li
        strong Upload 
        | a document.
      li 
        strong Edit 
        | the document's details, including name, description, visibility and permissions.
      li Get prompted to 
        strong share 
        | document on social media.
      li Be taken to your 
        strong profile page
        | .

  #hypotheses
    h2 Hypotheses and rationale
    p The ultimate goal is to increase the number of published documents. We were tackling retention; we want authors who have published once to publish again. Examining data, we found that a user was more likely to return to the site if they saw their profile page or document.
    blockquote "Authors who see their profile page in Month A are more likely to return in Month B."
    p Our goal was to increase the number of people who complete the upload process and see their profile page.

  #user-studies
    h2 User studies
    p I used anonymous user surveys to get feedback on the current upload process. We learned that most users found the "Edit Details" page overwhelming and confusing. I then set out to redesign it.

  #problem
    h2 Problem statement
    p.problem The current upload process is overwhelming and confusing. The goal is to increase the number of users who complete the upload process, increasing the number of published documents, and ultimately improving user retention.

  #redesign-details
    h2 Redesigning details page
    p I looked at different sites and their upload processes. From that research, I created three mockups.

      img.screenie.w50(src="img/portfolio/docscom-mockup-classic.png")
      img.screenie.w50(src="img/portfolio/docscom-mockup-wysiwyg.png")
      img.screenie.w50(src="img/portfolio/docscom-mockup-speedy.png")
    p.caption
      | 1. The classic. Similar to the current version but laid out neater.
      br
      | 2. WYSIWYG. Users see their document as they would normally on Docs.com, but in "Edit" mode.
      br
      | 3. The modal. A modal pop ups with the options separated into tabs.
    p Again, I used user studies to gather feedback. Users overwhelmingly hated the modal, thinking of it as a "pop-up". Also, by splitting up the form into tabs, users considered that as extra steps they had to take.
    p The WYSIWYG version resonated the most - user liked seeing their document concurrently and liked the large visuals. We decided to use these aspects in our redesign.

  #redesign-flow
    h2 Redesigning the flow
    p From examining competitors, I noticed that none had an explicit share dialog screen. Removing it decreases the number of steps in the process. Instead an explicit screen, we could just go straight to the document view, where share options exists.
    img.screenie(src="img/portfolio/docscom-redesign.png")
    p.caption The proposed redesign is reduced to three steps.

  #results
    h2 Results
    img.screenie(src="img/portfolio/docscom-implementation.png")
    p.caption Implementation of the Edit Details page. Description field shows hover state.
    p The redesign was A/B tested. This first iteration led to 
      strong 3% increase in completed uploads
      |  and 
      strong 4% increase in week-over-week retention
      | .
    p This was only the first iteration. Future iterations will hopefully see continual growth.
